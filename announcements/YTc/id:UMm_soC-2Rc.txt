As a CMD-Utils founder here:
In order to address the mess of this situation, I have a few points to address here. (pin request)

#1. CMD-Utils itself is not a rat or grabber BUT... I am not sure of the integrity of the creators provided mod, so just as a precaution, I have released a pre-compiled binary of the mod, which Coderx and I did not want to do, but in order to prevent this from happening it again, here is the only OFFICIAL download for CMD-Utils:

TLDR: https://github.com/Coderx-Gamer/cmd-utils/releases/download/1.0.2/cmd-utils-1.0.2.jar

#2. For the creator @Rippl3lol, In the spirit of the *.utils mods, I have decided to match the license of CMD-Utils with UI-Utils, which they are now BOTH under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)

disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, so take what I am about to say with a grain of salt:

I apologize for any inconvenience or that this has caused anyone, and I love the fact people have been using this to find dupes, and I thank you for contributing to the greater good of the utils community.
