As a CMD-Utils founder here:
In order to address the mess of this situation, I have a few points to address here. (pin request)

#1. CMD-Utils itself is not a rat or grabber BUT... I am not sure of the integrity of the creators provided mod, so just as a precaution, I have released a pre-compiled binary of the mod, which Coderx and I did not want to do, but in order to prevent this from happening it again, here is the only OFFICIAL download for CMD-Utils:

TLDR: https://github.com/Coderx-Gamer/cmd-utils/releases/download/1.0.2/cmd-utils-1.0.2.jar

#2. For the creator @Rippl3lol, In the spirit of the *.utils mods, I have decided to match the license of CMD-Utils with UI-Utils, which they are now BOTH under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International)

disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, so take what I am about to say with a grain of salt:

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:

According to Creative Commons. (n.d.). Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License. Section 1: Definitions, Article k. Retrieved from https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt

     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
     exchange."

And in order for you to abide by this, I kindly request that you replace all existing download links with the official link provided below.

I apologize for any inconvenience or that this has caused anyone, and I love the fact people have been using this to find dupes, and I thank you for contributing to the greater good of the utils community.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me via Discord at 'mrbreaknfix'.
