Hello, I have been trying to submit my mod that I have made, but whenever I have tried to submit it, I get the following message:


"
The status of the file uiutils-1.5.0.jar (uiutils) has been changed to Rejected
Notes:
Please do not submit other authors' projects.
If you have any questions please contact our support team https://support.curseforge.com.
"


I would like to assure you that I do have permission to publish this mod, as Coderx-Gamer and I are the creators of the mod.
The project started on GitHub, under Coderx-Gamers account, but we did not publish it on curseforge before.
I would like to prove that I am the author, so that I may upload my mod. In order to hopefully speed up the process, I have signed this message with GPG, and included it on the official website and it can be found here:

https://ui-utils.com/cf.txt.asc

You can find my public key at https://ui-utils.com/mrbreaknfix_pubkey.asc

I hope this helps to clear things up and allows me to post my mod,
Sincerely, MrBreakNFix.
