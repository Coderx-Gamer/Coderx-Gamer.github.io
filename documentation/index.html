                              UI-Utils has many features, which will be documented here. When opening an inventory / container 
                              with UI-Utils, you will notice some extra features, here is a list of those features with descriptions:<br />
                         </p>
                         <ul>
                              <li><b>Close without packet</b> - Close your GUI without sending a <code>CloseHandledScreenC2SPacket</code> to the server.</li>
                              <br />
                              <li><b>De-sync</b> - Send a <code>CloseHandledScreenC2SPacket</code> without closing your GUI client-side.</li>
                              <br />
                              <li>
                                   <b>Send packets: true / false</b> - When enabled, no GUI related packets will be sent 
                                   to the server (<code>ClickSlotC2SPacket</code> and <code>ButtonClickC2SPacket</code>.)
                              </li>
                              <br />
                              <li>
                                   <b>Delay packets: true / false</b> - When enabled, no GUI related packets will be sent 
                                   to the server (<code>ClickSlotC2SPacket</code> and <code>ButtonClickC2SPacket</code>) until disabled, then, 
                                   all delayed packets will be sent in the same tick.
                              </li>
                              <br />

                                   <b>Save GUI</b> - Saves your GUI internally and can be re-opened using a key-binding (default key-binding is 'v',) this 
                                   works well with the "Close without packet" feature.
                              </li>
                              <br />
                              <li><b>Disconnect and send packets</b> - Sends all queued packets from "Delay packets", then, immediately disconnects from the server.</li>
                              <br />
                              <li><b>Fabricate packet</b> - Opens a window that allows you to send any GUI packet any amount of times (see 'Fabricate Packet Feature' for more information.)</li>
                              <br />
                              <li><b>Copy GUI Title JSON</b> - Copies your GUI's title as JSON.</li>
                              <br />

                              <br />
                              <li><b>Revision: ??</b> - Shows your GUI's revision ID.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p class="center">
                              The text box below is a chat field for chatting or running commands while in a GUI. All of those features can be disabled / enabled by running "^toggleuiutils" in chat.

                         <h3 class="center">Fabricate Packet Feature</h3>
                         <p class="center">
                              Using the fabricate packet feature, you can create any GUI packet and send it any amount of times. When clicking "Fabricate packet", you will see a window prompting 
                              you for a packet to send ("Click Slot" or "Button Click",) another window should appear with some fields and a "Send" button when clicking "Click Slot" (<code>ClickSlotC2SPacket</code>), 
                              which is what will be documented. "Sync Id" and "Revision" should be whatever the "Sync Id" and "Revision" fields in your in-game GUI are. "Slot" should be a numeric ID 
                              for what slot you want to interact with (most slot ID(s) can be found on the internet.) The "Button" field is what button is being clicked, 0 is usually left click or 
                              represents no button, 1 is usually right click, it can also represent a hotbar slot (0 - 8) to swap to when using "SWAP" in the "Action" field, in that case, 40 represents your offhand. 
                              The "Action" field is the type of click slot packet you would like to send, the options are: (PICKUP: click item, PICKUP_ALL: double click item, 
                              QUICK_MOVE: shift click item, SWAP: swap item to hotbar, CLONE: middle click item, THROW: drop item, QUICK_CRAFT: used for quick crafting.) Clicking "Send" will send that packet. 
                              Clicking on "Button Click" in the packet option window, you can send a <code>ButtonClickC2SPacket</code>, which can click buttons on a GUI, for example, clicking on an enchantment 
                              in an enchanting table. "Sync Id" should be the same as the in-game "Sync Id" field in your Minecraft GUI, and "Button Id" should be whatever button you're clicking on (numeric ID starting at zero.)
                              Clicking "Send" will send that packet. You can send any GUI packet any amount of times by altering the "Times to send" field in any packet GUI. The "Delay" checkbox 
                              should be checked if you want to queue those packets into the "Delay packets" queue to send later (it will send those packets immediately still if "Delay packets" is off.)

                         <p class="center">
                              To get a jar file of UI-Utils, you can either build your own or download a pre-built one on the <a href="../releases/index.html" target="_blank">releases page</a>. To build 
                              your own jar, go to the link above, then, download a source code archive (ui-utils-x.x.x.tar.gz or ui-utils-x.x.x.zip), extract it, 
                              then, if you're on Linux, open a terminal in that directory and run:<br /><br />
                              <code class="align">chmod +x gradlew</code><br />
                              <code class="align">./gradlew build</code><br /><br />
                              If you're on Windows, open command prompt in that folder and run:<br /><br />
                              <code class="align">gradlew build</code><br /><br />
                              After that, your jar file should be at <code>build/libs/ui-utils-x.x.x.jar</code> which you can then use. Now that you have a jar file (pre-built or self-built,) you can install 
                              <a href="https://fabricmc.net" target="_blank">FabricMC</a>, then move your jar file into your "mods" directory (create it if it doesn't already exist,) then download 
                              <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api" target="_blank">Fabric API</a> and move that jar file into your "mods" directory as well. Launch Minecraft and UI-Utils should be installed.
